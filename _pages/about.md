Dr. Liting Wang is a PRiME Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy. With a robust interdisciplinary background spanning drug delivery, cancer biology, and biomaterials, Dr. Wang's work covers the entire spectrum, from developing cutting-edge lipid-based nanoparticles all the way to rigorous in vivo therapeutic and safety evaluations.

Dr. Wang completed her Ph.D. in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, focused on developing peptidomimetic drugs and gene-delivery lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to combat drug resistance and inhibit cancer metastasis. Her current research builds upon this expertise, concentrating on engineering blood-brain barrier-crossing lipid nanoparticles for the targeted treatment of challenging neurological conditions like glioblastoma and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. She employs a comprehensive approach, integrating nanoparticle formulation, molecular biology, and advanced in vivo models, including patient-derived xenograft(PDX), orthotopic, and brain tumor models, to meticulously assess therapeutic performance and biodistribution.

Dr. Wang also incorporates transcriptomic analysis, utilizing both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, to delve into treatment mechanisms and inform precision medicine strategies. Driven by a passion for interdisciplinary collaboration, she is aiming to translate groundbreaking biomedical innovations into tangible clinical solutions.
