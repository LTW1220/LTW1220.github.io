Tumor cells exhibit increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly hydrogen peroxide, creating an opportunity for Fenton reaction-based chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, under physiological conditions, the concentrations of both iron ion and hydrogen peroxide at the tumor site are typically insufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect. Additionally, the presence of the glutathione (GSH)-based antioxidant system in tumor cells further limits H₂O₂ accumulation. To overcome these limitations, a novel liposome-based nanocatalytic sensitizer (Vc-Fe(II)@CaP) designed to overcome AZD9291 resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by enhancing ferroptosis. The system leverages elevated hydrogen peroxide levels in tumor cells and introduces exogenous Fe²⁺ and vitamin C (Vc) to amplify hydroxyl radical production via the Fenton reaction. Vc not only regenerates hydrogen peroxide by reacting with Fe³⁺ and oxygen but also depletes intracellular GSH through its oxidized form (DHA), forming a closed-loop Vc-DHA-Vc cycle. This cycle boosts oxidative stress, inhibits GPX4 expression, and sensitizes drug-resistant NSCLC cells to ferroptosis while sparing normal cells. The findings highlight a promising therapeutic approach to treat drug-resistant cancers by targeting redox imbalance and iron metabolism.
